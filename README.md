# About Me:
👋 Hi, I'm Miguel! Thanks for visiting my profile 😁

I'm a Computer Science Graduate from the Lebanese American University. I've been in the software business since 2018 starting with Rust.

I am currently working on a documentation program that helps people curate better user manuals 💻. Hopefully we can also have multiple different types of manuals, maybe also an intruction manual.
